# DK Sentinel — Responsible Gaming Analytics Platform

DK Sentinel is a Responsible Gaming analytics platform built to mirror DraftKings’ analyst workflows using an aligned modern stack (SQL-first analytics, Snowflake-style querying, dashboards, audit logs, and AI-assist tooling). It simulates queue triage, case review, evidence gathering, regulatory trigger checks, and compliance-style reporting.

## Why It Matters
Responsible gaming requires fast, explainable, and auditable decisions. This project demonstrates how I build analyst-first workflows that combine SQL rigor, AI-assist tooling, and professional reporting while keeping human accountability front-and-center.

## Core Capabilities
- Queue → Case File → Audit Trail workflow
- SQL evidence logging with output previews
- AI assist with transparency (not replacement)
- State-specific regulatory trigger checks
- Professional PDF reporting

## What It Shows
- Advanced SQL and evidence-based analysis
- Data product development (dashboards, reports, audit logs)
- AI-enabled productivity with governance
- Reproducible workflows and strong documentation

## Tech Stack
React, TypeScript, FastAPI, DuckDB, Snowflake-style SQL, AI prompt routing, PDF reporting.
